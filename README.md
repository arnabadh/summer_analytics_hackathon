The dataset contains over 15,000 entries of descriptions of products on Amazon and Flipkart, including details like product title, ratings, reviews, and actual prices. In this challenge, I predicted the discounted prices('actprice1') of the listed products.
It contains two features namely 'Rating' and 'price1', found to be mostly correlated to the output that is 'actprice1'. So as to generalize the model, a certain portion of the data can be considered to have outlier values and thus have been excluded from consideration. Initially, I have done some Exploratory Data Analysis of the dataset and splitted it into train, test set. Further, I used Random Forest Regressor to instantiate a model and train it, using the features and predict the output. Finally I plotted the results against the test output. The Root Mean Squared Error turned out to be around 254.09.
